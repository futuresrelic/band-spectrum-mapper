## Leaderboard Page + Landing Page Overhaul (2026-05-17)

### Added

- **`/leaderboard` page** — public, dark-theme standalone page showing top scores for both games
  - Two tabs: Album Art Quiz | Word Hunt
  - Album Art Quiz: rank, player avatar/name, level, duration, score from `GET /api/game/leaderboard`
  - Word Hunt: rank, player, word used, wrong count, time, score from `GET /api/public/word-hunt/leaderboard`
  - Each tab has an inline "Play Now" CTA button

- **Landing page "Jump In" section** — new section between the hero and the features grid
  - Six cards linking to: Library, Explore Graph, Album Art Quiz, Word Hunt, Leaderboard, Rate Songs
  - Each card shows icon, description, auth note where relevant, and a color-coded CTA button
  - Dark slate background (bg-slate-900) to visually bridge the hero and the white features grid

- **Landing page nav** — added Explore, Games, and Leaderboard links alongside existing Library/Help

- **Landing page final CTA** — added Explore Graph and Leaderboard buttons alongside Browse Library

- **Landing page footer** — added Explore and Leaderboard links

- **UserLayout nav** — added Library, Explore, Games, and Leaderboard links for logged-in users browsing public pages

### Changed

- `App.tsx` — added `<Route path="/leaderboard" element={<LeaderboardPage />} />` as a public route

## Word Hunt — Bug Fix, Scope Toggle, Scoring & Leaderboard (2026-05-17)

### Fixed

- **Verify always returning wrong** — graph node IDs use `song:abc123` prefix; DB expects bare `abc123`.
  Strip prefix before `GET /api/public/word-hunt/verify` call.

### Added

- **"My bands" / "All bands" scope toggle** — controls both the word pool (challenge endpoint) and
  the graph displayed during play
- **Scoring** — `max(0, 1000 − wrongCount×100 − timeSec×2)`; auto-submitted on win via
  `POST /api/word-hunt/scores` (auth required)
- **Leaderboard panel** in the Word Hunt game page (collapsible, 15 entries)
- **Score + rank display** after winning; guests see a sign-in prompt
- **`WordHuntScore` Prisma model** (`word_hunt_scores` table): userId, word, attempts, wrongCount,
  timeSec, score, bandScope, createdAt. Railway will auto-create via `prisma db push`.
- **`POST /api/word-hunt/scores`** — auth-required route, validates and persists score, returns rank
- **`GET /api/public/word-hunt/leaderboard?limit=N`** — public route, top N scores with player info

  structural sections (agglomerative), spectral features, onset density, chroma
  profile, 13 MFCC means.
- Transparent heuristic scores (0–100) for all six BSM axes — each score shows
  contributing audio features, confidence rating, and plain-English explanation.
- YouTube metadata import (YouTube Data API v3 — title, channel, description,
  thumbnail, duration, tags). Metadata only; controlled by `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`.
- Canvas waveform and spectrogram visualizations; section timeline bar;

## Known Limitations (Initial Build)

- Authentication/authorization not implemented (single-user local deployment)
- NLP features are basic (unigram frequency; bigrams optional future work)
- Export polish may come after core flows are stable
- Word cloud library requires client-side rendering
- Railway deployment requires manual PostgreSQL provisioning on first setup
